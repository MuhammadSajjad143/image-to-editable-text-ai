📸 Image to Editable Text (OCR + AI)

This project is a SaaS-based web application that converts text from images into editable text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and optionally formats the extracted text using AI.

The application is built using Streamlit and deployed on a SaaS platform. It allows users to extract raw text from images and then enhance the readability of that text using an AI language model.
